# 🐍 Classic Snake Game

This is a web-based version of the classic Snake game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game runs in the browser and features smooth controls, collision detection, and an appealing retro-style interface.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the **Arrow Keys** on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake:
  - `↑` Up
  - `↓` Down
  - `←` Left
  - `→` Right
- The objective is to eat the red squares (food) to grow the snake.
- If the snake collides with itself, it resets to the initial state.
